# general-info
Right now we're trying to make the website similar to the bottom of this site:
http://www.apple.com/
Garrett and I so far have decided to use collapseable groups. 
We're are currently trying to display each section title horizontally across the bottom of the page.
So if anyone could figure out how to do that, it would be greatly appreciated.
