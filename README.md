# general-info
Right now we're trying to make the website similar to the bottom of this site:
http://www.apple.com/
Just figured out how to display the column titles horizontally
Now we need to figure out how to display the links underneath the column titles
I just uploaded a new zip file that has the new changes I made, the zip is called "More Changes"
If you have figured out the problem, I've given all group members permission to upload files.
